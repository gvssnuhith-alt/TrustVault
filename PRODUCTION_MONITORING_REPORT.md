# TRUSTVAULT PRODUCTION MONITORING & RELIABILITY REPORT

## 1. Health Probe Architecture
- **Liveness Probe:** `GET /healthz` (Responds in <10ms without initiating heavy database transactions).
- **Readiness Probe:** `GET /readyz` (Executes `SELECT 1` on PostgreSQL to confirm active connection pool).
- **Edge Routing Aliases:** `/api/healthz` and `/api/readyz` mapped to backend root for seamless Vercel edge proxying.

## 2. Zero-Cost Telemetry Implementation
- Application logs emitted as structured JSON stdout for native Render log viewing.
- Request correlation IDs generated via UUID for end-to-end request tracing.
