| Issue ID | Severity | Component | Summary | Status | Resolution |
|----------|----------|-----------|---------|--------|------------|
| ISS-001 | Critical | Frontend Base URL | Hardcoded dead Cloudflare tunnel URL | RESOLVED | Changed to dynamic `/api` reverse proxy with `VITE_API_URL` support |
| ISS-002 | High | Backend Routes | Missing `PATCH /{id}` and `DELETE /{id}` endpoints | RESOLVED | Added mutation routes with audit logging |
| ISS-003 | High | Backend Schemas | Grant permission Pydantic schema rejected usernames | RESOLVED | Allowed username and email string with case-insensitive DB query |
| ISS-004 | High | Backend Query | Revoke permission failed when ID was permission record ID | RESOLVED | Updated query with `or_(grantee_id, id)` and audit logging |
| ISS-005 | High | Frontend | React unhandled exception on `metrics.chain_status` | RESOLVED | Fixed key access to `metrics.chain_integrity?.status` |
| ISS-006 | Medium | Responsive Layout | 320px viewport overflowed by 37px | RESOLVED | Refactored compact buttons and enforced `overflow-x-hidden` |
| ISS-007 | Medium | Frontend State | Active tab stayed on 'audit' after logout | RESOLVED | Reset `activeTab` to 'vault' on logout |
| ISS-008 | High | Auth Security | Old JWT token could still access APIs after logout | RESOLVED | Added `RevokedToken` table, hashed token on logout, enforced check in `get_current_user` |
| ISS-009 | Medium | API Protocol | Upload exceeding 10MB returned HTTP 400 instead of 413 | RESOLVED | Patched `routes_documents.py` to return `HTTP_413_REQUEST_ENTITY_TOO_LARGE` |
| ISS-010 | Low | Deployment Config| Missing `.env.example` documenting `VITE_API_URL` | RESOLVED | Added `frontend/.env.example` with deployment configuration |
| ISS-011 | High | Audit Integrity | Race condition in concurrent audit log writes broke hash chain | RESOLVED | Enforced PostgreSQL transactional advisory locks (`pg_advisory_xact_lock(77123991)`) |
| ISS-012 | Medium | Dependency / Clean Clone | Fresh clone failed on `EmailStr` and grantee username revocation | RESOLVED | Added `pydantic[email]` & `email-validator` to `requirements.txt`; updated grantee resolution |
| ISS-013 | High | Remote Production Infrastructure | Remote Render backend timed out; Vercel pointed to dead Cloudflare tunnel | RESOLVED | Migrated unified FastAPI serverless backend directly onto Vercel Python Runtime (`/api/index.py`) |
| ISS-014 | High | Serverless Payload Barrier | Vercel Function payload limit capped at 4.5MB, preventing 10MB file uploads | RESOLVED | Implemented S3 presigned PUT/GET direct uploads (`/upload-intent` & `/confirm-upload`) |
| ISS-015 | High | Cross-Worker Hash Chain Fork | Multi-instance serverless concurrency caused forks in previous_hash | RESOLVED | Added `pg_advisory_xact_lock` in `backend/app/audit.py` and `/api/audit/heal-chain` maintenance endpoint |
