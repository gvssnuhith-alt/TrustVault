# 12 — SECURITY & PENETRATION COMPLIANCE AUDIT
## Adversarial Attack Surface & Vulnerability Assessment

- **BOLA / IDOR Defense**: Strict verification in `check_document_access()`. Returns 404 on unowned/unshared documents to prevent ID enumeration.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Viewers cannot grant permissions or delete documents (enforced server-side with HTTP 403).
- **File Validation & Magic Bytes**: Files disguised as PDFs without valid `%PDF` magic bytes are rejected with HTTP 400 Bad Request.
- **Advisory Mutation Defense**: Test suite includes deliberate mutation checks proving tests fail if authorization checks are removed.
- **Cryptographic Audit Ledger**: Tamper simulation proves modifying past database log entries invalidates chain verification immediately.
- **Security Compliance Status**: **PASS** (Zero critical or high vulnerabilities).
