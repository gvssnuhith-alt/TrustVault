## 2. Storage Architecture & Privacy Controls

1. **Private S3 Bucket**:
   - `trustvault-docs` bucket has public access strictly disabled.
   - Files are stored with cryptographic UUID prefixes (`{uuid}_{filename}`).
   - Direct anonymous access to storage URLs is refused with HTTP 403.

2. **Presigned URL Lifecycle**:
   - Upload URLs expire in 300 seconds (5 minutes).
   - Download URLs expire in 300 seconds and are issued only after database-backed authorization verification.
   - Downloads utilize HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect to offload Vercel Function memory and bandwidth.

3. **Data Integrity & Cryptographic Checksums**:
   - Client precomputes SHA-256 digest before initiating upload.
   - S3 stores file, and backend confirmation locks the exact hash and byte count in PostgreSQL.
   - Downloaded bytes match uploaded bytes bit-for-bit.
